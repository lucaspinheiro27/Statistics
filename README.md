### Statistics using Python

This repository is designed to approach a series of statistics notebooks, which I use to solve problems that I'm curious about. I created this repository to master statistics and solve everyday problems. Also to learn something new every day. The project contains two folders initially, [csv](csv) containing all csv and xlsx files used to make the analyses and [Jupyter notebooks](Jupyter_notebooks) containing python code.

### Clone this repository
